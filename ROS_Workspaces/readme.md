# Description
Folder for organising ROS/ROS2 Workspaces.

`dev_ros/ros2_workspace` are used to store custom packages created for the project.
`ros/ros2_workspace` are the active workspaces.

## ros_workspace
Purposefully empty, is setup using the CaydeLauncher.

## dev_ros_workspace
Contains
- `isaac_ur5_connector`.
- `isaac_moveit_connector` - this works but causes stuttering due to it being inherently blocking. 

## ros2_workspace
Currently unused.

## dev_ros2_workspace
Currently unused.
